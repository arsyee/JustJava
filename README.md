# JustJava

This repository holds an example Kotlin implementation of the JustJava app developed during the Udacity courses [Android Basics: User Interface](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud834) and [Android Basics: User Input](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud836).

Even though you can freely fork this repository, it is highly advised to take the referred courses instead and develop the app for yourself.
